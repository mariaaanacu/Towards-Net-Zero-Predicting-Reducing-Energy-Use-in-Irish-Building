    "\n",
    "##  Introduction\n",
    "In this phase, I conducted a **detailed examination of the dataset** to identify and handle potential **outliers, anomalies, and inconsistencies**. The main objective was to ensure that the data is **clean, reliable, and ready for further analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I followed several key steps:\n",
    "- **Checked for missing values** to ensure completeness.\n",
    "- **Identified duplicate records** that might distort analysis.\n",
    "- **Detected numerical outliers** in key variables.\n",
    "- **Analyzed large building areas** to validate extreme values.\n",
    "- **Reviewed negative BER values** to confirm if they represent actual energy-efficient buildings.\n",
    "- **Checked U-values** for insulation consistency.\n",
    "- **Conducted final dataset verification** to ensure all cleaning rules were correctly applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Steps Taken in Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Missing Values**\n",
    "- I analyzed the dataset to detect **any missing values**.\n",
    "- If missing values were found, I identified the affected columns for further processing.\n",
    "- This ensured that all necessary data points were **accounted for**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Duplicate Records**\n",
    "- I checked for **duplicate rows** that could affect the dataset’s validity.\n",
    "- The duplicate analysis was based on:\n",
    "  - `CountyName` (location)\n",
    "  - `DwellingTypeDescr` (building type)\n",
    "  - `Year_of_Construction` (construction year)\n",
    "  - `BerRating` (energy efficiency score)\n",
    "- The number of duplicate rows was recorded for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Detecting and Analyzing Outliers**\n",
    "I performed outlier detection using the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** on key numerical variables:\n",
    "- **Year_of_Construction** (to detect unrealistic values)\n",
    "- **BerRating** (to identify extreme energy efficiency values)\n",
    "- **UValueWall, UValueRoof, UValueFloor, UValueWindow, UvalueDoor** (to assess insulation performance)\n",
    "- **WallArea, RoofArea, FloorArea** (to flag buildings with unusually large or small dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each column:\n",
    "- I calculated **lower and upper bounds** using IQR.\n",
